# 4-to-2-priority-encoder
This code implements a 4-line to 2-line priority encoder with an enable input and two enable outputs. The 4-line to 2-line encoder features priority encoding of its four inputs (I3, I2, I1, and I0) to ensure that only the highest-order data line is encoded. This device encodes the four data lines to 2-lines binary (A1 and A0).
